	<h3>Data Is Plural</h3>

	<p>A ten week project visualising a dataset each week from the <a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural">Data Is Plural</a> newsletter sent out weekly by <a href="https://twitter.com/jsvine">Jeremy Singer-Vine</a>.</p>


	<h4>Week 1: UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h4>

	<div id="whc"><img src="img/WHC.svg"></div>

	<h4>Week 2: Book mobiles of the mainland United States</h4>

	<p id="visText">Book mobiles seem something of an anachronism in modern times. As access to the internet increases and books are increasingly available in digital format you could be forgiven for expecting vehicles travelling around carrying physical books to become unneeded. However, in North America they are still thriving and although almost 50% of book mobiles which were operating 1992 are no longer operational, there are still around 600 which are. Some states still have many whereas Kansas and Maine only have a single one each.</p>

 	<h4>Week 3: Heights of the world</h4>

 	<p id="visText">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) have put together estimates of changes in height sizes from 1896 to 1996. The variance in height size between men and women provides some interesting insights with men in Africa generally showing a reduction in height comapared to women with Asia showing the opposite trend.</p>

	<h4>Week 4: Um, maybe coming soon...</h4>


	<h4>Week 5: Physical inactivity</h4>

 	<p id="visText">Took a slight tangent on this one. The dataset in the email was about broadband access but also in the datasetwas a whole host of health-related indicators. I had wanted to make a choropleth for a while so it all fitted together nicely. Nationally, almost a quarter of Americans do no physical exercise according to the data.</p>

	<h4>Week 6: Violent crime in twenty largest cities in the United States</h4>

 	<p id="visText">The Marshall Project has collected data from the FBI on violent crime in the United States. Below is visualised the data for the top 20 cities by population. Looks like the mid-1990s weren't the best times to live in large cities in the US but things have improved regardless of what some politicians might say.</p>
